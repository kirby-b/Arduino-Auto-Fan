# Arduino Auto Fan
Building an arduino device that turns on a fan when my room gets too hot.

# How to use
Build the device as instructed in the blueprint and instruction manual provided. Then make sure you have the .ino file running on your arduino device. I used the Arduino from the Elegoo Super Starter Kit
